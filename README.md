# llm-skills

A small, varied collection of **Agent Skills** for fun and testing.

Skills in this repo are markdown-based instructions that help the AI assistant with specific domains (e.g. a UI library, a law, a workflow). They live under `skills/` and can be used as project skills when working in this repo or copied into your own projects.

## What’s in here

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **lgpd-brasil** | Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD – Lei 13.709/2018): concepts, principles, legal bases, data subject rights, ANPD, practical checklist. |
| **mantine-ui** | Mantine React components, theming, hooks, and setup (PostCSS, providers, forms, dates). |

## Purpose

- **For fun** – Experiment with different skill styles and topics.
- **Testing** – Try how well the agent uses domain-specific instructions.
- **Reference** – Keep a few ready-to-use skills in one place.

Not intended as an official or exhaustive skill library. Use and adapt as you like.

## Using these skills

- **In this repo**: Skills under `skills/` are project skills; Cursor can use them when the description matches the conversation.
- **Elsewhere**: Copy a skill folder (e.g. `skills/lgpd-brasil/`) into your project’s `skills/` or into `~/.cursor/skills/` for personal use.
